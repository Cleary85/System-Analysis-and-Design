Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DrivePass project was a company that wanted to build a web based interface to sell, manage, and execute driver's education for people who were going to be taking the written
and practical tests involved with get a driver's license

What did you do particularly well?
One portion that I did particular well was the development of system requirments. I was able to put out in plain language what the system needed to do in order to properly function
and succesfully fulfill the customer requirments.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the use case diagram for the system design document. The mapping out of use cases individually was relatively easy but I could have done a better job either grouping those
use cases where appropriate and having others as stand alone use cases in a way that provided more context and information, which would have made the diagram more elegant that in it's
present form.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The biggest portion of interpreting the user's needs was listening to what they stated as required abilities of the system and translating that into functions of a system. While a user
might say they want a system to preform task X, that doesn't capture what the system might have to do either in the fore or background to achieve the end goal of task X and making that
connection, due to my background as an analyst, ensures that the end goal of a task is met. Considering the user's needs is vital to desinging a system because it is thier system. The
user wants a system that fills thier needs and if it doesn't, then they will either cancel the project outright or go in another direction or with another company. In the end the analyst
isn't designing a system for themselves but for a user.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When appoaching software design, I look at what the requirments are and start coming up with what objects are required to hold the required data and how those objects will operate either on 
themselves or other objects to gather, store, and manipulate the data in route to meeting requirements. By understanding how I want these objects interact, I can start building out what I
expect an object to do and if that object will need to create more specialized sub-objects to handle specific sub-types of parent objects and build a map of how these objects will interact.
